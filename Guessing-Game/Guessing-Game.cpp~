// No global variables (global constants are all right)
// No strings (cstrings/character arrays can be used, and the cstring and cctype libraries are okay. Recommendation: use strcmp and strlen in projects.)
// Include <iostream>, not stdio Also, use "new" and "delete" instead of "malloc" and "free"

#include <iostream>
